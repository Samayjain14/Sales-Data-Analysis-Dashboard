# Sales Data Analysis (Python)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using Python to uncover key insights about revenue, customer behavior, and product performance.  
The goal is to demonstrate how data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization can transform raw business data into actionable insights for decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Dataset**: Sales dataset (`Train-Set.csv`)  

## Key Analysis & Insights
- Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, formatting data).  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations.  
- Identified revenue trends across different regions and time periods.  
- Analyzed product category performance and contribution to sales.  
- Customer behavior analysis to understand purchasing patterns.  
- Derived insights useful for marketing, inventory management, and strategy.
